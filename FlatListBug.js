This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The performance is significantly degraded, and the app becomes unresponsive or crashes. This is particularly noticeable on lower-end devices or when dealing with complex item renderers.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

The issue stems from the `FlatList` trying to render all items at once, or inefficient rendering of items as the list is scrolled.
