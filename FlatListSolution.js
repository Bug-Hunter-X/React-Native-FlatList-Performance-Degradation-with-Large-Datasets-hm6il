To address this performance issue, we should implement several optimizations:

1. **Windowing/Virtualization:** Only render the items currently visible on the screen.  This can be done using the `windowSize` prop of `FlatList`, or by implementing custom virtualization techniques.

2. **Item Optimization:** Simplify the `renderItem` function. Avoid computationally expensive operations within the renderer. Consider using `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of individual list items if their props haven't changed.

3. **Data Handling:** Use efficient data structures and algorithms to manage your data.  If your data is static or doesn't change often, consider caching or pre-processing it. 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <OptimizedItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={5} // Adjust as needed
/>

// OptimizedItemComponent
const OptimizedItemComponent = React.memo(({item}) => {
  // ... simplified rendering logic ...
});
```

By combining these techniques, we can drastically improve the performance of the `FlatList` even with large datasets.
